Reasons for this are non-existent standards, changing specifications d ue t o rapid development, common usage of the off-chain storage, and lack of developers. One of such blockchains is Polkadot - a layer- zero blockchain featuring a single relay chain whose role is to secure smart contract transactions on multiple other parachains. In this paper we describe a data collection pipeline for Polkadot blockchain that we then use to perform an analysis of the bow-tie structure of its transfer network over time, with special emphasis on the role of nominators and validators in this structure. We find evidence that t he Polkadot ecosystem iss lowly maturing from a system dominated by nominators and validators, both of which require some technical skill as well as willingness to bond sufficient amount of funds, into a system increasingly populated by regular users using the financial services of Polkadot.", "Published in": [{"name": "2023 IEEE International Conference on Blockchain and Cryptocurrency (ICBC)", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/10174862/proceeding"}], "Authors": [{"name": "Matija Piskorec", "from": "Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technologies Group, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"}, {"name": "Ben Domenic James Murphy", "from": "University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"}, {"name": "Florian R\u00fcegsegger", "from": "University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"}, {"name": "Sina Rafati Niya", "from": "Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technologies Group, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"}, {"name": "Claudio J.
