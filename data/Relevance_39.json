TESTBED2 is a large interdisciplinary European research project that focuses on developing new techniques to improve the scalability of smart grid services using new technologies such as blockchain. In the current paper we explained a general architecture of Testbed2 system that includes blockchain as a certification authority. Next to the description of the system in the current paper we present the blockchain implementation together with policies for smart grid authorization.", "Published in": [{"name": "2022 IEEE International Conference on Blockchain, Smart Healthcare and Emerging Technologies (SmartBlock4Health)", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/10034644/proceeding"}], "Authors": [{"name": "Mandana Falahi", "from": "University POLITEHNICA of Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania"}, {"name": "Andrei Vasilateanu", "from": "University POLITEHNICA of Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania"}, {"name": "Nicolae Goga", "from": "University POLITEHNICA of Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania"}, {"name": "George Suciu", "from": "BEIA Consult International, Romania"}, {"name": "Mari-Anais Sachian", "from": "BEIA Consult International, Romania"}, {"name": "Robert Florescu", "from": "University POLITEHNICA of Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania"}, {"name": "Haider Abdullah Ali", "from": "University POLITEHNICA of Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania"}, {"name": "Yi Qian", "from": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Nebraska, United States"}], "IEEE keywords": ["Authorization", "Distributed ledger", "Scalability", "Organizations", "Fabrics", "Blockchains", "Smart grids"], "Author Keywords": ["smart grids", "blockchain", "authorization"]}
