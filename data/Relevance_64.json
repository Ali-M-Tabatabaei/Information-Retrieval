Combining the blockchain with access control can solve the problems such as single point of failure and opaque authority judgment in traditional centralized access control systems. The access control system of the system pays more attention to the framework design, ignoring the influence of the uncertainty of the entity's behavior after authentication on the blockchain network. Based on this, we propose a distributed access control system based on blockchain. Based on the ABAC model, the policy decision point, policy management point, and attribute authority are completed through smart contracts deployed by nodes in the blockchain network. The main function. The experimental results show that the scheme is feasible and effective, realizes decentralization, transparent authority judgment, and supports dynamic and fine-grained access control system.", "Published in": [{"name": "2022 2nd International Conference on Computer Science and Blockchain (CCSB)", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/10071526/proceeding"}], "Authors": [{"name": "Haichao Wang", "from": "Information Engineering University"}, {"name": "Zhiyu Ren", "from": "Information Engineering University"}, {"name": "Tianpeng Zhang", "from": "Information Engineering University"}, {"name": "Qiuli Wang", "from": "Information Engineering University"}], "IEEE keywords": ["Access control", "Computer science", "Uncertainty", "Distributed ledger", "Smart contracts", "Prototypes", "Authentication"], "Author Keywords": ["access control", "blockchain", "smart contract"]}
