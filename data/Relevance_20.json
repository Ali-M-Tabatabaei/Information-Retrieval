However, due to the distributed nature of blockchain, we may face implementation difficulties and high operational costs, for example. To facilitate this process, we propose a customizable blockchain-based document registration service that makes it possible to create different types of gen-eralized documents for various application domains and store them in one or more blockchains integrated in an Application Programming Interface (API).", "Published in": [{"name": "2022 IEEE International Conference on Blockchain and Cryptocurrency (ICBC)", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/9805458/proceeding"}], "Authors": [{"name": "Pamella Soares", "from": "Blockchain One, Graduate Program in Computer Science \u2013 State University of Ceara (UECE), Fortaleza, Cear\u00e1"}, {"name": "Raphael Saraiva", "from": "Blockchain One, Graduate Program in Computer Science \u2013 State University of Ceara (UECE), Fortaleza, Cear\u00e1"}, {"name": "Iago Fernandes", "from": "Blockchain One, Graduate Program in Computer Science \u2013 State University of Ceara (UECE), Fortaleza, Cear\u00e1"}, {"name": "Ant\u00f4nio Neto", "from": "Blockchain One, Graduate Program in Computer Science \u2013 State University of Ceara (UECE), Fortaleza, Cear\u00e1"}, {"name": "Jerffeson Souza", "from": "Blockchain One, Graduate Program in Computer Science \u2013 State University of Ceara (UECE), Fortaleza, Cear\u00e1"}], "IEEE keywords": ["Costs", "Conferences", "Blockchains", "Cryptocurrency", "Faces", "Application programming interfaces"], "Author Keywords": ["Document Storage", "API", "Blockchain"]}
