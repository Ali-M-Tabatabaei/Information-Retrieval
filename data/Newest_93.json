Concerns about security and protection are being addressed using blockchain technologies and machine language calculations. A few studies have looked at both blockchain strategies and calculations in machine language. Last but not least, we cover security and protection difficulties in the field using machine language calculations and blockchain methods, and we highlight and educate many snags and future test subjects. Due to the inclusion of devices in numerous apps, concerns over the safety and security of the customers have intensified. Blockchain techniques are becoming increasingly used in current IoT applications to handle security and protection problems. However, these investigations use machine learning or blockchain techniques to deal with security or protection issues, necessitating a comprehensive assessment of current initiatives to deal with security and protection issues using machine learning and blockchain techniques.", "Published in": [], "Authors": [{"name": "P.K.
