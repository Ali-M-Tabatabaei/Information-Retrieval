A PoS blockchain relies on external clocks, and each node synchronizes its local clock according to an external clock using Network Time Protocol (NTP) or a similar protocol. However, this external dependence is undesirable because it reduces the autonomy, sustainability and trustless nature of the blockchain. This paper presents a clock synchronization protocol for slot-based PoS blockchains. The proposed protocol estimates the block propagation time to ensure that the synchronization is closer to that of a real-world clock. In addition, the proposed method considers the clock drift and clock adjustment frequency to achieve more accurate synchronization. Simulation experiments show that the proposed method can synchronize with a time that is closer to that of a real-world clock and with higher accuracy than existing methods.", "Published in": [{"name": "2022 IEEE International Conference on Blockchain (Blockchain)", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/9881788/proceeding"}], "Authors": [{"name": "Yuya Miki", "from": "Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"}, {"name": "Kazuyuki Shudo", "from": "Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan"}], "IEEE keywords": ["Protocols", "Blockchains", "Synchronization", "Frequency synchronization", "Sustainable development", "Clocks"], "Author Keywords": ["Blockchain", "Clock synchronization", "Block propagation time", "Ethereum"]}
