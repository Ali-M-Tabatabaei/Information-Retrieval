Unraveling the State-of-the-Art Smart Contract Fuzzers", "Pages": null, "Cites in Papers": 0, "Cites in Patents": 0, "Full Text Views": 0, "Publisher": "IEEE", "DOI": "10.1145/3597503.3639152", "Date of Publication": "14-20 April 2024", "abstract": "Given the growing importance of smart contracts in various applications, ensuring their security and reliability is critical. Fuzzing, an effective vulnerability detection technique, has recently been widely applied to smart contracts. Despite numerous studies, a systematic investigation of smart contract fuzzing techniques remains lacking. In this paper, we fill this gap by: 1) providing a comprehensive review of current research in contract fuzzing, and 2) conducting an in-depth empirical study to evaluate state-of-the-art contract fuzzers' usability. To guarantee a fair evaluation, we employ a carefully-labeled benchmark and introduce a set of pragmatic performance metrics, evaluating fuzzers from five complementary perspectives. Based on our findings, we provide direction for the future research and development of contract fuzzers.", "Published in": [{"name": "2024 IEEE/ACM 46th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE)", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/10548016/proceeding"}], "Authors": [{"name": "Shuohan Wu", "from": "The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"}, {"name": "Zihao Li", "from": "The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"}, {"name": "Luyi Yan", "from": "The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"}, {"name": "Weimin Chen", "from": "The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"}, {"name": "Muhui Jiang", "from": "The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"}, {"name": "Chenxu Wang", "from": "Xi\u2019 an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"}, {"name": "Xiapu Luo", "from": "The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"}, {"name": "Hao Zhou", "from": "The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"}], "IEEE keywords": ["Measurement", "Systematics", "Reviews", "Smart contracts", "Fuzzing", "Benchmark testing", "Security"], "Author Keywords": ["Smart Contract", "Fuzzing", "Evaluation"]}
