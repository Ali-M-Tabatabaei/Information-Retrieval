Using these characteristics, blockchain technology is being used in various fields, but the anonymity of blockchain can be exploited for illegal trades in the Darknet market. Therefore, a monitoring system for transactions occurring on the blockchain is needed. This paper proposes a monitoring system and an explorer to show the results collected from the system.", "Published in": [{"name": "2019 IEEE International Conference on Blockchain and Cryptocurrency (ICBC)", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/8744142/proceeding"}], "Authors": [{"name": "Chaehyeon Lee", "from": "Department of Computer Science and Engineering, POSTECH, Korea"}, {"name": "Heegon Kim", "from": "Department of Computer Science and Engineering, POSTECH, Korea"}, {"name": "Sajan Maharjan", "from": "Department of Computer Science and Engineering, POSTECH, Korea"}, {"name": "Kyungchan Ko", "from": "Department of Computer Science and Engineering, POSTECH, Korea"}, {"name": "James Won-Ki Hong", "from": "Department of Computer Science and Engineering, POSTECH, Korea"}], "IEEE keywords": ["Blockchain", "Monitoring", "Bitcoin", "Databases", "Synchronization", "Servers", "Data visualization"], "Author Keywords": ["Blockchain Explorer", "Blockchain monitoring system", "RPC-based monitoring agent"]}
