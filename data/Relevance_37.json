Each of these blockchains has attempted to address the scalability and consumption issues of Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchains from different angles. However, the economic incentives of these blockchains have raised the concern about the decentralisation level of key players, such as validators, and stakeholders, in those \u201cexpected to be decentralised\u201d networks. In this work, we conduct an analysis of Cardano's activity and wealth concentration. For the first time, we perform a clustering of the addresses that belong to the same wallet based on existing heuristics for UTXO-like blockchains. Moreover, an analysis of reward distribution on Cardano is presented. The analysis results of this work disclose objective insights into the Cardano blockchain, including the rewards distribution, stake balance distribution, and wealth concentration.", "Published in": [{"name": "2023 IEEE International Conference on Blockchain and Cryptocurrency (ICBC)", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/10174862/proceeding"}], "Authors": [{"name": "Sina Rafati Niya", "from": "Department of Informatics, Blockchain & Distributed Ledger Technologies Group, University of Zurich, Switzerland"}, {"name": "Ivana Mesi\u0107", "from": "Department of Informatics, Blockchain & Distributed Ledger Technologies Group, University of Zurich, Switzerland"}, {"name": "Georgios Anagnostou", "from": "Department of Informatics, Blockchain & Distributed Ledger Technologies Group, University of Zurich, Switzerland"}, {"name": "Gabriele Brunini", "from": "Department of Informatics, Blockchain & Distributed Ledger Technologies Group, University of Zurich, Switzerland"}, {"name": "Claudio J.
