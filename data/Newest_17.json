However, attacks targeting smart contracts are increasing, causing an estimated\n6.45billioninfinanciallosses.Researchershaveproposedvariousautomatedsecuritytoolstode\n2.3 billion in losses, and a survey of 49 developers and auditors working in leading DeFi protocols. Our findings reveal a stark reality: the tools could have prevented a mere 8% of the attacks in our dataset, amounting to\n149millionoutofthe\n2.3 billion in losses. Notably, all preventable attacks were related to reentrancy vulnerabilities. Furthermore, practition-ers distinguish logic-related bugs and protocol layer vulnerabilities as significant threats that are not adequately addressed by existing security tools. Our results emphasize the need to develop specialized tools catering to the distinct demands and expectations of developers and auditors. Further, our study highlights the necessity for continuous advancements in security tools to effectively tackle the ever-evolving challenges confronting the DeFi ecosystem.", "Published in": [{"name": "2024 IEEE/ACM 46th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE)", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/10548016/proceeding"}], "Authors": [{"name": "Stefanos Chaliasos", "from": "Imperial College London, United Kingdom"}, {"name": "Marcos Antonios Charalambous", "from": "Imperial College London, United Kingdom"}, {"name": "Liyi Zhou", "from": "Imperial College London, United Kingdom"}, {"name": "Rafaila Galanopoulou", "from": "University College London, United Kingdom"}, {"name": "Arthur Gervais", "from": "National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece"}, {"name": "Dimitris Mitropoulos", "from": "University College London, United Kingdom"}, {"name": "Benjamin Livshits", "from": "Imperial College London, United Kingdom"}], "IEEE keywords": ["Surveys", "Smart contracts", "Computer bugs", "Ecosystems", "Finance", "Decentralized applications", "Blockchains"], "Author Keywords": ["Blockchain", "Security", "Smart Contracts", "Ethereum", "Empirical Evaluation", "Security Tools", "Surveys"]}
