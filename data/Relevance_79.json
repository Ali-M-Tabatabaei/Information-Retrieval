China is a world-leader in satellite remote sensing, however the data resources are highly concentrated in few institutions and the data distribution is centralized and separated. As blockchain applies more widely, it offers a new way for satellite remote sensing data sharing. This paper analyzes the feasibility of combining blockchain and satellite remote sensing data sharing, tying to finds out the binding point by analyzing the satellite remote sensing data structure. Comparing satellite remote sensing data entity and derived data, this article proposes a preliminary design and architecture of blockchain to share satellite remote sensing metadata. At last an analysis of advantages and challenges is given.", "Published in": [{"name": "2022 2nd International Conference on Computer Science and Blockchain (CCSB)", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/10071526/proceeding"}], "Authors": [{"name": "Hongjuan Liu", "from": "China Aero Geophysical Survey and Remote Sensing Center for Natural Resources"}, {"name": "Gang Wang", "from": "Northwest Non-ferrous Mining Corporation"}, {"name": "Wenji Li", "from": "China Aero Geophysical Survey and Remote Sensing Center for Natural Resources"}], "IEEE keywords": ["Computer science", "Satellites", "Metadata", "Data structures", "Blockchains", "Remote sensing"], "Author Keywords": ["blockchain", "satellite remote sensing", "data share", "derived data", "metadata"]}
