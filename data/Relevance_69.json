Traditional IoT access control systems are centralized and do not include all the stakeholders in the access control decision making process. To fill this gap, we propose a permissioned blockchain based access control system for IoT where a different phase of access control like creating access policy and making the access control decision happens based on the consensus of all the stakeholders. To be more specific, we design and implement Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) in a permissioned blockchain called Hyperledger Fabric and leverage its smartcontract and distributed consensus to enable a distributed access control for IoT. The effectiveness of our proposed system is demonstrated by the performance evaluation result in an IoT testbed.", "Published in": [{"name": "2019 IEEE International Conference on Blockchain (Blockchain)", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/8938397/proceeding"}], "Authors": [{"name": "Md.
