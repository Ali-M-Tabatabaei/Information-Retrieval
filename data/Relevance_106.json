Blockchains allow for decentralisation and prevent tampering, meaning that blockchain technology meets the requirements of internal auditing. This article discusses the impact of blockchain technology on internal auditing. By analysing the characteristics of blockchain technology and how these characteristics are useful for internal auditing, this article explores and constructs the operation mode of \u2018blockchain + internal auditing\u2019 and then analyses the application concerns around its operation mode. It also discusses the transformation of internal auditing functions under this model.", "Published in": [{"name": "2020 2nd International Conference on Applied Machine Learning (ICAML)", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/9607029/proceeding"}], "Authors": [{"name": "Rubing Liu", "from": "School of Accounting/Audit Governance and Risk Control Research Centre, Guangdong University of Foreign Studies, Guangzhou, China"}], "IEEE keywords": ["Deep learning", "Economics", "Law", "Data security", "Blockchains", "Information technology"], "Author Keywords": ["blockchain", "internal audit", "operation mode"]}
