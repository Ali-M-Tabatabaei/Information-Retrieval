This leads to high operating cost when deploying these relays between Ethereum-based blockchains where validating block headers on-chain is computationally expensive.To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel relay scheme that employs a validation-on-demand pattern combined with economic incentives to reduce the cost of operating a relay between Ethereum-based blockchains by up to 92%. With this relay scheme, decentralized interoperability between blockchains like Ethereum and Ethereum Classic becomes feasible.", "Published in": [{"name": "2020 IEEE International Conference on Blockchain (Blockchain)", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/9284404/proceeding"}], "Authors": [{"name": "Philipp Frauenthaler", "from": "Christian Doppler Laboratory for Blockchain Technologies for the Internet of Things Distributed Systems Group, TU, Wien, Vienna, Austria"}, {"name": "Marten Sigwart", "from": "Christian Doppler Laboratory for Blockchain Technologies for the Internet of Things Distributed Systems Group, TU, Wien, Vienna, Austria"}, {"name": "Christof Spanring", "from": "Pantos GmbH, Vienna, Austria"}, {"name": "Michael Sober", "from": "Christian Doppler Laboratory for Blockchain Technologies for the Internet of Things Distributed Systems Group, TU, Wien, Vienna, Austria"}, {"name": "Stefan Schulte", "from": "Christian Doppler Laboratory for Blockchain Technologies for the Internet of Things Distributed Systems Group, TU, Wien, Vienna, Austria"}], "IEEE keywords": ["Economics", "Conferences", "Blockchain", "Reliability", "Relays", "Optimization", "Interoperability"], "Author Keywords": ["blockchain interoperability", "cross-blockchain communication", "blockchain relay", "simplified payment verification"]}
