Blockchains are layered systems where security is a critical factor for their success. The main focus of this work is to systematize knowledge about security and privacy issues of blockchains. To this end, we propose a security reference architecture based on models that demonstrate the stacked hierarchy of various threats as well as threat-risk assessment using ISO/IEC 15408. In contrast to the previous surveys [23], [88], [11], we focus on the categorization of security vulnerabilities based on their origins and using the proposed architecture we present existing prevention and mitigation techniques. The scope of our work mainly covers aspects related to the nature of blockchains, while we mention operational security issues and countermeasures only tangentially.", "Published in": [{"name": "2019 IEEE International Conference on Blockchain (Blockchain)", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/8938397/proceeding"}], "Authors": [{"name": "Ivan Homoliak", "from": "Singapore University of Technology and Design"}, {"name": "Sarad Venugopalan", "from": "Singapore University of Technology and Design"}, {"name": "Qingze Hum", "from": "Singapore University of Technology and Design"}, {"name": "Pawel Szalachowski", "from": "Singapore University of Technology and Design"}], "IEEE keywords": ["Peer-to-peer computing", "Consensus protocol", "Cryptography", "Routing"], "Author Keywords": ["surveys and tutorials", "blockchain", "reference architecture"]}
