This model has problems such as inconsistent traceability standards, inaccurate traceability information, and data distortion, which make it difficult for consumers to identify with the traceability results. To solve this problem, this paper proposes to track the transactions of each node of the power supply chain based on the blockchain smart contract and hash algorithm, achieve safe and reliable traceability of the power supply chain, improve the commercial value of traceable information, and increase the trust between each node of the supply chain.", "Published in": [{"name": "2022 2nd International Conference on Computer Science and Blockchain (CCSB)", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/10071526/proceeding"}], "Authors": [{"name": "Peng Liu", "from": "China Electric Power Research Institute, Beijing, China"}, {"name": "Chunyu Deng", "from": "China Electric Power Research Institute, Beijing, China"}, {"name": "Dazhong Wang", "from": "China Electric Power Research Institute, Beijing, China"}], "IEEE keywords": ["Hash functions", "Power supplies", "Smart contracts", "Supply chains", "Data models", "Encoding", "Blockchains"], "Author Keywords": ["electric power", "traceability", "blockchain", "smart contract"]}
