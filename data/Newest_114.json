Fortunately, there is hope in the form of a novel approach to problem solving: the combination of blockchain and machine learning. This article delves at the potential of combining blockchain technology with machine learning for use in Smart City Intelligent Traffic Management Systems (ITMS). With blockchain technology, data can be managed safely and openly, allowing for authenticated, near-real-time monitoring of traffic data. Thus, the accuracy of traffic management data is improved, and the possibility of manipulation is reduced. Algorithms in machine learning enable data analysis and predictive analytics. Large-scale traffic data analysis can optimize traffic patterns to improve urban mobility. This article examines how machine learning and blockchain technology may complement each other. This study examines the benefits of the two technologies and how their combination strengthens IT management systems. The research also examines possible issues and benefits of a holistic approach. This innovative combination of technologies can improve urban traffic management and quality of life by improving data security, traffic forecast accuracy, and urban planning efficiency.", "Published in": [{"name": "2024 IEEE 13th International Conference on Communication Systems and Network Technologies (CSNT)", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/10545643/proceeding"}], "Authors": [{"name": "Vijilius Helena Raj", "from": "Department of Applied Sciences, New Horizon College of Engineering, Bangalore"}, {"name": "Y Manohar Reddy", "from": "Institute of Aeronautical Engineering, Dundigal, Hyderabad"}, {"name": "Pushpendra Singh Danghi", "from": "Department of Computer Science & Engineering, IES College of Technology, Bhopal, M.
