It is important to ensure the trustworthiness of the heterogeneous IoT data. To address this requirement, the data provenance needs to be used in the IoT system. In this article, we integrate the PROV-DM model into the IoT architecture and propose an IoT data provenance model. To avoid corrupting and forging the provenance information, we record the provenance data onto the blockchain. In addition, we use the IoT secure and computable data sharing system to illustrate that the proposed model can construct a provenance graph to detect which agent operates the IoT data abnormally. Finally, we implement and evaluate the proposed model on a public IoT database.", "Published in": [{"name": "2022 2nd International Conference on Computer Science and Blockchain (CCSB)", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/10071526/proceeding"}], "Authors": [{"name": "Shuang Sun", "from": "Postdoctoral Research Station of China Central Depository & Clearing Co., Ltd., Beijing, China"}, {"name": "Huayun Tang", "from": "Blockchain Lab, China Central Depository & Clearing Co., Ltd., Beijing, China"}, {"name": "Rong Du", "from": "School of Microelectronics, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"}], "IEEE keywords": ["Databases", "Computational modeling", "Computer architecture", "Throughput", "Data models", "Sensor systems", "Blockchains"], "Author Keywords": ["IOT", "data provenance", "PROV-DM", "blockchain"]}
