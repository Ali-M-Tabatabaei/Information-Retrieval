In the decentralized world of Web3, financial management companies are increasingly investing in blockchain ledger systems for asset transactions. As a result, new models of portfolio trading are needed. The paper presents a prototype of a portfolio management system with a machine learning-enabled recommend subsystem. The proposed account role mechanism combines user-defined functions and automated asset management operations. The combination of blockchain and artificial intelligence enables smart portfolio management.", "Published in": [{"name": "2023 IEEE 13th International Conference on Electronics Information and Emergency Communication (ICEIEC)", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/10199110/proceeding"}], "Authors": [{"name": "Tianhong Cai", "from": "UNNC-NFTZ Blockchain Laboratory, School of Computer Science, University of Nottingham Ningbo China, Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, China"}, {"name": "Jiawei Wu", "from": "School of Computer Science, University of Nottingham Ningbo China, Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, China"}, {"name": "Chenyang Yu", "from": "School of Computer Science, University of Nottingham Ningbo China, Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, China"}, {"name": "Vladimir Brusic", "from": "School of Computer Science, University of Nottingham Ningbo China, Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, China"}], "IEEE keywords": ["Smart contracts", "Prototypes", "Whales", "Machine learning", "User interfaces", "Market research", "Blockchains"], "Author Keywords": ["Portfolio Management", "Blockchain", "Machine Learning", "Account Role", "Smart Contract"]}
