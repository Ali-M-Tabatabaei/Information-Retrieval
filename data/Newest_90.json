The integration of these technologies can provide significant benefits to cloud\u2010based environments by enhancing security, privacy, and data management. This paper proposes an architecture that combines AI, blockchain, and IoT in a cloud\u2010based environment. The proposed architecture provides a secure and reliable platform for data exchange and analysis, enabling the development of smart applications that can improve the efficiency, productivity, and quality of life. The architecture's core components are the IoT sensors, AI algorithms, and blockchain technology, which ensure data security and privacy, immutability, and transparency. The proposed architecture can be used in various applications, such as healthcare, logistics, and smart cities. In summary, this chapter provides an overview of the benefits and challenges associated with the integration of AI, blockchain, and IoT and proposes a novel architecture that can leverage these technologies to improve cloud\u2010based environments\u2019 efficiency and security. This research work will discuss about futuristic technology and their role in respective fields in detail.", "Published in": [], "Authors": [{"name": "V.
