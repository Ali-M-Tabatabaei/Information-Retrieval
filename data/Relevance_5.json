We identify existing threats to the wallet scheme and existing work done to both attack and secure the scheme. We provide an overview the proposed model and outline justification for our methods. We follow with next steps in our remaining work and the overarching goals and motivation for our methods.", "Published in": [{"name": "2019 IEEE International Conference on Blockchain (Blockchain)", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/8938397/proceeding"}], "Authors": [{"name": "Amanda Davenport", "from": "University of Minnesota"}, {"name": "Sachin Shetty", "from": "Old Dominion University"}], "IEEE keywords": ["Malware", "Blockchain", "Atmospheric modeling", "Mathematical model", "Media", "Security", "Electromagnetics"], "Author Keywords": ["Attack Surface, Private Key Storage, Permissioned Blockchain, Air Gapped Storage, Air Gapped Wallet, Key Extraction, Channel Exfiltration, Markov Model"]}
