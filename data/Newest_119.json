Decentralized identification, semantic data, blockchain, and zero-knowledge proofs are just few of the concepts that are examined in depth to provide the groundwork for this technique. The main goal is to figure out what kinds of hardware are needed to implement these theoretical principles. Subsequently, the technique continues to extract the hardware requirements, distinguishing the unique demands, problems, and performance criteria important for enabling Web3.0 and edge intelligence. These needs include a wide range of topics, including performance, safety, efficiency, scalability, and even compatibility. Once the theoretical principles and hardware requirements are fully understood, the technique moves on to the design step. Key to realizing these abstract ideas is the development of specialized hardware architectures and components. Based on the outcomes of the performance assessment, iterative refinement is carried out to fix the hardware's flaws and enhance its functionality. As a result of this iterative process, hardware is kept up to date to suit the ever-shifting requirements of Web3.0 and edge intelligence. The suggested technique concludes with an emphasis on flexibility and future-proofing in light of the everchanging nature of Web3.0 and edge intelligence. Keeping up with technology developments and reevaluating the hardware design as needed are both part of this process.", "Published in": [{"name": "2024 IEEE 13th International Conference on Communication Systems and Network Technologies (CSNT)", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/10545643/proceeding"}], "Authors": [{"name": "Shashikant Patil", "from": "Department of uGDX, ATLAS SkillTech University, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India"}, {"name": "Pawan Bhambu", "from": "Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Vivekananda Global University, Jaipur, India"}, {"name": "D Preethi", "from": "Department of Computer Science and Information Technology, Jain (Deemed to be University), Bangalore, India"}], "IEEE keywords": ["Measurement", "Systematics", "Scalability", "Semantics", "Hardware", "Blockchains", "Safety"], "Author Keywords": ["Adaptability", "Algorithm", "Blockchain", "Decentralized Identity", "Edge Intelligence", "Hardware Design", "Iterative Refinement", "Performance Evaluation", "Performance Metrics", "Prototyping", "Real-World Validation", "Semantic Data", "Theoretical Concepts", "Validation", "Web3.0"]}
