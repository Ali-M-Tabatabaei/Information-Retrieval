To enhance agricultural productivity quantitively and in terms of quality, farmers have adopted the emerging IoT and communication technologies to establish automated monitoring and control systems. This adoption of novel technologies enables farmers to deal with traditional practice problems. However, the solutions provided by this new concept reveal a wide range of research issues. Since security and privacy are the top concerns in IoT environments, it's important to think about potential attacks and develop countermeasures. In this paper, we present a simple security analysis in the IoT-based smart agriculture field. Then, considering the crucial role of authentication in IoT security, we reviewed the different classes of authentication in this field.", "Published in": [{"name": "2024 4th International Conference on Innovative Research in Applied Science, Engineering and Technology (IRASET)", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/10548014/proceeding"}], "Authors": [{"name": "Souhayla Dargaoui", "from": "Department of Computer Science, Faculty of Sciences and Technics, Moulay Ismail University of Meknes Errachidia, Morocco"}, {"name": "Mourade Azrour", "from": "Department of Computer Science, Faculty of Sciences and Technics, Moulay Ismail University of Meknes Errachidia, Morocco"}, {"name": "Ahmad El Allaoui", "from": "Department of Computer Science, Faculty of Sciences and Technics, Moulay Ismail University of Meknes Errachidia, Morocco"}, {"name": "Azidine Guezzaz", "from": "Technology Higher School Cadi, Ayyad University Essaouira, Morocco"}, {"name": "Said Benkirane", "from": "Technology Higher School Cadi, Ayyad University Essaouira, Morocco"}, {"name": "Abdulatif Alabdulatif", "from": "Department of Computer Science, College of Sciences and Arts Qassim University Buraydah, Saudi Arabia"}, {"name": "Fatima Amounas", "from": "Department of Computer Science, Faculty of Sciences and Technics, Moulay Ismail University of Meknes Errachidia, Morocco"}], "IEEE keywords": ["Smart agriculture", "Protocols", "Taxonomy", "Authentication", "Logic gates", "Robustness", "Sensors"], "Author Keywords": ["IoT", "Smart agriculture", "Security", "Mutual authentication"]}
