In order to ensure the security of the video, we use data hiding technology to embed message that can ensure the security of the video into the video, at the same time, in order to improve the non-tamperability and non-forgery of data hiding. We construct the hash value of the message embedded in the original video, the hash value of the carrier video (video with embedded message) and the attribute message of the video as video metadata, and upload the video metadata to the blockchain network. Comparing the message extracted from the carrier video with the video metadata stored on the blockchain can achieve double verification of the video. At the same time, distributed storage of carrier video through IPFS can effectively store and manage large-scale video data, ensuring the security and high availability of videos.", "Published in": [{"name": "2023 IEEE International Conference on Blockchain (Blockchain)", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/10411431/proceeding"}], "Authors": [{"name": "Zhenghang Zhao", "from": "School of Cyber Science and Engineering, Zhengzhou University"}, {"name": "Yunxia Liu", "from": "Zhengzhou Normal University"}, {"name": "Hongguo Zhao", "from": "Zhengzhou Normal University"}, {"name": "Yonghao Wang", "from": "Birmingham City University"}], "IEEE keywords": ["Steganography", "Collaboration", "Metadata", "Copyright protection", "Blockchains", "Security"], "Author Keywords": ["Blockchain", "Data hiding", "IPFS", "Video verification"]}
