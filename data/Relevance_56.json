One way to handle digital assets on a blockchain is through tokens. Tokens define chunks of data on a blockchain, allowing it to be distributed like virtual currency. However, storing all data related to digital assets in a token is difficult. Data is currently managed separately because storing a large amount of data in a blockchain can cause the ledger to grow large. When the management of data depends on a particular organization, the stability of the token's value depends on that particular organization. In this paper, we propose an organization-independent management method that combines a distributed content-addressable file system with a blockchain. Our proposed method places the data associated with the token and the access information to the token into the distributed content-addressable file system. As a result, the token associated with the data has the sharing control of the data stored in the distributed content-addressable file system, and a configuration independent of the specific contract is realized.", "Published in": [{"name": "2019 IEEE International Conference on Blockchain (Blockchain)", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/8938397/proceeding"}], "Authors": [{"name": "Shigenori Ohashi", "from": "NTT Service Evolution Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Kanagawa, Japan"}, {"name": "Hiroki Watanabe", "from": "NTT Service Evolution Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Kanagawa, Japan"}, {"name": "Tatsuro Ishida", "from": "NTT Service Evolution Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Kanagawa, Japan"}, {"name": "Shigeru Fujimura", "from": "NTT Service Evolution Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Kanagawa, Japan"}, {"name": "Atsushi Nakadaira", "from": "NTT Service Evolution Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Kanagawa, Japan"}, {"name": "Junichi Kishigami", "from": "Muroran Institute of Technology, Hokkaido, Japan"}], "IEEE keywords": ["Blockchain", "Contracts", "File systems", "Distributed databases", "Data structures", "Cryptography", "Laboratories"], "Author Keywords": ["IPFS", "blockchain", "ethereum", "token", "access control", "sharing control", "p2p", "content-addressable file system"]}
