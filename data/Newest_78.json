By utilizing digital intelligence technology to analyze and grasp the laws of risk development in Guangdong lychee supply chain, we can effectively prevent and avoid risks, and promote the stable development of the supply chain network. Based on this, this study first identified the risk factors of the lychee supply chain in Guangdong Province through expert interviews and literature review; Secondly, factor analysis, analytic hierarchy process, and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation methods are comprehensively used to evaluate the risks of the supply chain; Finally, based on the results of risk assessment and combined with digital intelligence technology, a risk response strategy is proposed.ct.", "Published in": [{"name": "2024 8th International Conference on Management Engineering, Software Engineering and Service Sciences (ICMSS)", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/10550190/proceeding"}], "Authors": [{"name": "Fanfan Jia", "from": "Management Department, Guangdong University of Science &Technology, Dongguan, China"}, {"name": "Xia Yu", "from": "Management Department, Guangdong University of Science &Technology, Dongguan, China"}], "IEEE keywords": ["Supply chain management", "Bibliographies", "Supply chains", "Analytic hierarchy process", "Agricultural products", "Risk management", "Digital intelligence"], "Author Keywords": ["Agricultural product supply chain", "Litchi", "Risk management", "Digital Intelligence"]}
