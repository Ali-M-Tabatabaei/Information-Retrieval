However, the existing technical means have single tracking indicators, low reliability, difficult supervision, and can not track the consumption of users safely, transparently and efficiently. The paper introduces blockchain technology into renewable energy consumption voucher transaction. Firstly, it introduces the problems faced by renewable energy power consumption vouchers; Secondly, it studies the key technologies of blockchain to meet the power consumption demand of renewable energy; Finally, a renewable energy power consumption voucher management method based on blockchain technology is designed.", "Published in": [{"name": "2021 International Conference on E-Commerce and E-Management (ICECEM)", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/9636881/proceeding"}], "Authors": [{"name": "Tingting Duan", "from": "State Grid E-Commerce Co., Ltd., Beijing, China"}, {"name": "Da Li", "from": "State Grid E-Commerce Co., Ltd., Beijing, China"}, {"name": "Qinglei Guo", "from": "State Grid E-Commerce Co., Ltd., Beijing, China"}, {"name": "Hejian Wang", "from": "State Grid E-Commerce Co., Ltd., Beijing, China"}, {"name": "Desheng Bai", "from": "State Grid E-Commerce Co., Ltd., Beijing, China"}], "IEEE keywords": ["Renewable energy sources", "Power demand", "Costs", "Government", "Process control", "Controllability", "Blockchains"], "Author Keywords": ["renewable energy power", "blockchain technology", "consumption certificate"]}
