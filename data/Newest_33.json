Park et al. claimed that their scheme could resist various attacks and ensure both of privacy and data integrity. However, with thorough analysis of their scheme, we find that it suffers from three flaws.", "Published in": [{"name": "2024 10th International Conference on Applied System Innovation (ICASI)", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/10547719/proceeding"}], "Authors": [{"name": "Ya-Fen Chang", "from": "Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taichung University of Science and Technology, Taichung, Taiwan"}, {"name": "Jia-Yen Wu", "from": "Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taichung University of Science and Technology, Taichung, Taiwan"}, {"name": "Wei-Liang Tai", "from": "Bachelor Degree Program of Artificial Intelligence, National Taichung University of Science and Technology, Taichung, Taiwan"}], "IEEE keywords": ["Privacy", "Technological innovation", "Resists", "Load management", "Denial-of-service attack", "Demand response", "Smart meters"], "Author Keywords": ["privacy", "smart grid", "blockchain", "demand response"]}
