These intelligent devices have been producing a huge amout of useful data over time, however there is still a lack of a platform which can efficiently transfer and utilize the value of the massive IoT data. Blockchain is able to transfer value with a relative low cost, which makes it possible for the data from smart devices to create economic value. This work of this paper is to design a high performance blockchain platform, using technologies such as distributed network architecture, intelligent devices node mapping, as well as PBFT-DPOC consensus algorithm to realize the decentralized autonomy of intelligent devices.", "Published in": [{"name": "2018 1st IEEE International Conference on Hot Information-Centric Networking (HotICN)", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/8589966/proceeding"}], "Authors": [{"name": "Shitang Yu", "from": "Department of Research and Development, GRG Banking Blockchain, Guang Zhou, China"}, {"name": "Kun Lv", "from": "Department of Research and Development, GRG Banking Blockchain, Guang Zhou, China"}, {"name": "Zhou Shao", "from": "China Computer Federation, Technical Committee of Blockchain"}, {"name": "Yingcheng Guo", "from": "Department of Research and Development, GRG Banking Blockchain, Guang Zhou, China"}, {"name": "Jun Zou", "from": "Department of Research and Development, GRG Banking Blockchain, Guang Zhou, China"}, {"name": "Bo Zhang", "from": "Department of Research and Development, GRG Banking Blockchain, Guang Zhou, China"}], "IEEE keywords": ["Blockchain", "Performance evaluation", "Consensus algorithm", "Maintenance engineering", "Internet of Things", "Computer architecture", "Hardware"], "Author Keywords": ["Blockchain", "Intelligent Device Nodes Mapping", "PBFT-DPOC"]}
