Enterprise organizations are increasingly utilizing permissioned blockchains to manage and store their organizations\u2019 data and transactions in a private immutable ledger. Interoperability enables permissioned blockchain platforms to communicate and exchange information which is paramount for fully exploiting permissioned blockchains as facilitators for B2B applications. Additionally, the cross-network invocation of smart contracts under agreed conditions enhances business operations. Blockchain oracles can enable permissioned blockchain interoperability and cross-network transactions in a seamless and private manner. However, they have not been studied in the literature as interoperability techniques between permission blockchains. This study proposes a blockchain oracle interoperability technique designed specifically for permissioned blockchain platforms. We presented the architecture of the blockchain oracle interoperability technique and a prototypical implementation to demonstrate the practicality of the proposed technique. In addition, we obtained cross-network transaction latency measurements and analyzed the results.", "Published in": [{"name": "IEEE Access", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=6287639"}], "Authors": [{"name": "Asma A.
