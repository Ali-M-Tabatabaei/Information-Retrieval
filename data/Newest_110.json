The foundation of any social equality is the legitimacy of citizens\u2019 selection of their own representatives. This implementation of electronic voting technology, which includes biometric authentication in restricted hardware environments. The design efficiently tackles resource scarcity associated with embedded systems while guarding robustly against meddling and unauthorized access. It elaborates on the structure, integrating biometric sensors, secure communication practices, and agreement mechanisms with block chain frameworks. Moreover, it discusses the application of voter authentication, the voting interface, and auditing processes to check election results. This proposed system propels forward the development of secure electronic voting systems and proves to be a hopeful prospect for democratic processes in this rapidly digitalizing world.", "Published in": [{"name": "2024 International Conference on Communication, Computing and Internet of Things (IC3IoT)", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/10550185/proceeding"}], "Authors": [{"name": "K.
