To guide decision making in this regard, we systematically explore this architectural design space and possible solution strategies. More precisely, we provide architectural design decisions and decision options in terms of patterns and practices. Our research shows that most design decisions are influenced by the need to offset current blockchain drawbacks such as scalability, privacy, and usability by using centralized elements. This suggests that a hybrid architecture is beneficial in many design situations.", "Published in": [{"name": "2021 IEEE International Conference on Blockchain and Cryptocurrency (ICBC)", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/9460986/proceeding"}], "Authors": [{"name": "Maximilian W\u00f6hrer", "from": "Faculty of Computer Science, Research Group Software Architecture, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria"}, {"name": "Uwe Zdun", "from": "Faculty of Computer Science, Research Group Software Architecture, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria"}], "IEEE keywords": ["Privacy", "Software architecture", "Scalability", "Decision making", "Blockchain", "Computer architecture", "Usability"], "Author Keywords": ["blockchain", "software architecture", "decentralized application", "DApp", "smart contract", "design pattern"]}
