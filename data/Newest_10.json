Existing state-of-the-art methods rely on deep learning to mitigate this threat. They treat each input contract as an independent entity and feed it into a deep learning model to learn vulnerability patterns by fitting vulnerability labels. It is a pity that they disregard the correlation between contracts, failing to consider the commonalities between contracts of the same type and the differences among contracts of different types. As a result, the performance of these methods falls short of the desired level. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel Contrastive Learning Enhanced Automated Recognition Approach for Smart Contract Vulnerabilities, named Clear. In particular, Clear employs a con-trastive learning (CL) model to capture the fine-grained correlation information among contracts and generates correlation labels based on the relationships between contracts to guide the training pro-cess of the CL model. Finally, it combines the correlation and the semantic information of the contract to detect SCVs. Through an empirical evaluation of a large-scale real-world dataset of over 40K smart contracts and compare 13 state-of-the-art baseline methods. We show that Clear achieves (1) optimal performance over all base-line methods; (2) 9.73%-39.99% higher F1-score than existing deep learning methods.", "Published in": [{"name": "2024 IEEE/ACM 46th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE)", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/10548016/proceeding"}], "Authors": [{"name": "Yizhou Chen", "from": "Key Lab of HCST (PKU), MOE, School of Computer Science, Peking University, Beijing, China"}, {"name": "Zeyu Sun", "from": "Science & Technology on Integrated Information System Laboratory, Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"}, {"name": "Zhihao Gong", "from": "Key Lab of HCST (PKU), MOE, School of Computer Science, Peking University, Beijing, China"}, {"name": "Dan Hao", "from": "Key Lab of HCST (PKU), MOE, School of Computer Science, Peking University, Beijing, China"}], "IEEE keywords": ["Deep learning", "Training", "Correlation", "Smart contracts", "Semantics", "Fitting", "Blockchains"], "Author Keywords": ["Smart contract", "Vulnerability detection", "Deep learning", "Contrastive learning"]}
