However, several challenges such as low processing speed, scalability, and vulnerability to certain attacks have been identified, making it difficult to apply the technology on general industrial applications. In this paper, we propose a new application service platform architecture on top of blockchain that resolves those challenges. The proposed architecture takes advantage of private blockchain to secure processing speed and security while allowing public open use of the system by dividing the system into multiple layers. Assuming arbitrary nodes can participate in service, we propose periodic node verification process and `query-chain' to effectively authenticate and validate arbitrary nodes.", "Published in": [{"name": "2019 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/8932631/proceeding"}], "Authors": [{"name": "Youhawn Seol", "from": "ABC Inc., Republic of Korea Seoul, Republic of Korea"}, {"name": "Jaehong Ahn", "from": "ABC Inc., Republic of Korea Seoul, Republic of Korea"}, {"name": "Sehyun Park", "from": "ABC Inc., Republic of Korea Seoul, Republic of Korea"}, {"name": "Mookeun Ji", "from": "ABC Inc., Republic of Korea Seoul, Republic of Korea"}, {"name": "Jeongyeup Paek", "from": "ABC Inc., Republic of Korea Seoul, Republic of Korea"}, {"name": "Heungseok Chae", "from": "Chung-Ang University Seoul, Republic of Korea Seoul, Republic of Korea"}, {"name": "Jiheon Yi", "from": "Chung-Ang University Seoul, Republic of Korea Seoul, Republic of Korea"}, {"name": "Youngju Kim", "from": "Chung-Ang University Seoul, Republic of Korea Seoul, Republic of Korea"}], "IEEE keywords": ["Blockchain", "Peer-to-peer computing", "Reliability", "Computer architecture", "Bitcoin", "Smart contracts"], "Author Keywords": ["blockchain", "application platform", "hierarchical architecture", "decentralization"]}
