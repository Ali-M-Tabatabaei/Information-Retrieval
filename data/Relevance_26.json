Metadata is often stored in centralized cloud servers, which limits the decentralization of the blockchain. Alternatively, metadata can be integrated into distributed storage systems to achieve full decentralization of blockchain networks. However, evaluating the performance of distributed storage systems is often neglected. To address this gap, we present a framework that includes a set of technical indicators. We specifically focus on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) as an illustrative distributed storage system and provide a practical use case to demonstrate the application of our framework.", "Published in": [{"name": "2023 IEEE International Conference on Blockchain (Blockchain)", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/10411431/proceeding"}], "Authors": [{"name": "Ghassan Al-Sumaidaee", "from": "ECE., McGill University, Montreal, Canada"}, {"name": "Rami Alkhudary", "from": "Universit\u00e9 Paris-Panth\u00e9on-Assas, LARGEPA, Paris, France"}, {"name": "Zeljko Zilic", "from": "ECE., McGill University, Montreal, Canada"}, {"name": "Andraws Swidan", "from": "Department of Computer Engineering, University of Jordan, Amman, Jordan"}], "IEEE keywords": ["Medical services", "Metadata", "Decentralized applications", "Blockchains", "InterPlanetary File System", "Servers"], "Author Keywords": ["Blockchain", "Distributed storage system", "IPFS", "Healthcare"]}
