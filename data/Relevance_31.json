The key problem with existing works is that they fail to balance security and flexibility in their designs. These studies would have been more useful if they could provide a sense of security without compromising their flexibility. We hypothesize that two offline parties having loosely synchronized clocks and channels with known bounded latency can conduct off-chain transactions while maintaining a high level of security and flexibility: we introduce a novel blockchain-based offline payment protocol that supports our hypothesis. Our work leverages on-chain smart contracts and offline wallet interactions to build resilience against intermittent on-chain connectivity. Our protocol achieves flexible and trusted computations with the use of platform-agnostic Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) and open transactions. We empirically evaluate our design over the mainstream Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) and compare our protocol with state-of-the-art solutions. We found that our protocol attains high efficiency and exhibits an advanced level of security and flexibility in functionality. We evaluate our construction against several real-world attacks. We prove the security and robustness of our scheme based on a practical universally composable framework with synchronous settings. This work contributes to the existing knowledge of safe and user-friendly offline payment solutions for the blockchain technology.", "Published in": [{"name": "IEEE Transactions on Computers", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=12"}], "Authors": [{"name": "Wanqing Jie", "from": "Institute of Artificial Intelligence, Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Future Blockchain and Privacy Computing, Beihang University, Beijing, China"}, {"name": "Wangjie Qiu", "from": "Institute of Artificial Intelligence, Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Future Blockchain and Privacy Computing, Beihang University, Beijing, China"}, {"name": "Arthur Sandor Voundi Koe", "from": "State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"}, {"name": "Jianhong Li", "from": "Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain, Guangzhou University, Guangdong, China"}, {"name": "Yin Wang", "from": "Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain, Guangzhou University, Guangdong, China"}, {"name": "Yaqi Wu", "from": "Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain, Guangzhou University, Guangdong, China"}, {"name": "Jin Li", "from": "Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain, Guangzhou University, Guangdong, China"}, {"name": "Zhiming Zheng", "from": "Institute of Artificial Intelligence, Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Future Blockchain and Privacy Computing, Beihang University, Beijing, China"}], "IEEE keywords": ["Security", "Blockchains", "Smart contracts", "Metadata", "Threat modeling", "Scalability", "Forgery"], "Author Keywords": ["Blockchain", "offline payment", "smart contract", "security", "flexible", "protocol"]}
