Though significant progress has been achieved in reusing, remanufacturing, and recycling materials, using blockchain in the circular supply chain is still a relatively new idea and particularly challenging in the building industry. As a result, this study focuses on the importance of blockchain and circular economy in built-environment supply chains. We show the application method of utilising a blockchain-enabled digital platform and the idea of material passports to efficiently monitor materials and resources in the built environment. Based on the methodologies of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), Life Cycle Costing (LCC), and Building Information Management (BIM), we suggest that blockchain can be used to track environmental performance (e.g. materials, energy, and carbon emissions) and value creation opportunities at each stage of the building life cycle.", "Published in": [{"name": "2021 IEEE International Conference on Blockchain (Blockchain)", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/9680465/proceeding"}], "Authors": [{"name": "Qian Li", "from": "Cardiff Business School, Cardiff University, United Kindgom"}, {"name": "Yingli Wang", "from": "Cardiff Business School, Cardiff University, United Kindgom"}], "IEEE keywords": ["Industries", "Building information management", "Supply chains", "Ecosystems", "Collaboration", "Blockchains", "Recycling"], "Author Keywords": ["Blockchain", "circular economy", "supply chains", "built environment"]}
