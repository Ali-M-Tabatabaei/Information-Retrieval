However, if an attacker has access to calculation hash power greater than half of the total hash power, this attacker can create a double-spending attack or 51% attack. The cost of creating a 51% attack is surprisingly low if hash power is abundantly available. That posts a great threat to lots of PoW blockchains. We propose a technique to combine history weighted information of miners with the total calculation difficulty to alleviate the 51% attack problem. Analysis indicates that with the new technique, the cost of a traditional attack is increased by two orders of magnitude.", "Published in": [{"name": "2019 IEEE International Conference on Blockchain (Blockchain)", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/8938397/proceeding"}], "Authors": [{"name": "Xinle Yang", "from": "MOAC Blockchain Tech Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA"}, {"name": "Yang Chen", "from": "MOAC Blockchain Tech Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA"}, {"name": "Xiaohu Chen", "from": "MOAC Blockchain Tech Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA"}], "IEEE keywords": ["Peer-to-peer computing", "Blockchain", "History", "Protocols", "Switches", "Cryptography", "Data mining"], "Author Keywords": ["Blockchain, 51% Attack, Mining, Double spending attack"]}
