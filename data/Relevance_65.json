To meet these requirements new frameworks and platforms have appeared. Tasks set for a certain blockchain greatly determine the choice of design and its implementation. For example presence or absence of tokens; whether it is documentary, private or public; for banking sphere or social need. All these criteria should be taken into account while creating a blockchain thus saving time and money. The article has reviewed and analyzed the existing solutions and what models they are appropriate for.", "Published in": [{"name": "2020 International Multi-Conference on Industrial Engineering and Modern Technologies (FarEastCon)", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/9270648/proceeding"}], "Authors": [{"name": "A.
