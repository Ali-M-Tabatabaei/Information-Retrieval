The integration of futuristic technologies in smart manufacturing presents endless opportunities for manufacturers to increase efficiency, reduce costs, and improve product quality. However, to fully realize the benefits of these technologies, manufacturers must embrace automation, data, collaboration, training, and flexibility. The successful implementation of futuristic technologies in smart manufacturing requires a culture of innovation and continuous improvement as well as a willingness to take risks and try new approaches. By using data to make data\u2010driven decisions, manufacturers can improve product quality and reduce waste, creating a positive impact on the environment. Smart manufacturing also creates new job opportunities in programming, data analysis, and robotics. Ultimately, the integration of futuristic technologies in smart manufacturing is essential for the continued growth and success of the manufacturing industry.", "Published in": [], "Authors": [{"name": "Amit Kumar Tyagi", "from": "School of Computer Science and Engineering, Vellore Institute of Technology, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India"}, {"name": "Anand Kumar Mishra", "from": "Computer Science and Engineering, NIIT University, Neemrana, Rajasthan, India"}, {"name": "Nalla Vedavathi", "from": "Department of Fashion Technology, National Institute of Fashion Technology, New Delhi, Delhi, India"}, {"name": "Vijayalakshmi Kakulapati", "from": "Sreenidhi Institute of Science and Technology, Hyderabad, Telangana, India"}, {"name": "S.
