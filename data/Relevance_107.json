This concept has disrupted many industries including IoT. Researchers have found that blockchain has the proficiency to provide a solution for IoT software-related security issues including improper authentication of a device, unauthorized connection with a device, physical and hardware security flaws. The major challenge lies in integrating Blockchain with resource-constrained devices of IoT at the thing layer. This paper provides a broad perspective of integrating these two technologies. It highlights the guidelines for the necessity of blockchain for IoT based applications and a summary of the related work carried out on the integration of Blockchain with IoT. A successful experimental setup was done to implement blockchain on IoT based Smart Laboratory system to show the feasibility of the integration.", "Published in": [{"name": "2020 5th International Conference on Computing, Communication and Security (ICCCS)", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/9276407/proceeding"}], "Authors": [{"name": "Smita Dange", "from": "Department of Computer Engg, Pillai College of Engg., Navi Mumbai, India"}, {"name": "Madhumita Chatterjee", "from": "Department of Computer Engg, Pillai HOC College of Eng, Rasayani, India"}], "IEEE keywords": ["Blockchain", "Security", "Computer architecture", "Internet of Things", "Smart contracts", "Medical services", "Automation"], "Author Keywords": ["Internet of Thing", "Blockchain"]}
