Coupled with a hybrid discrete-event based network simulator, our proposed system has the ability to replay transactions that occurred on Ethereum's mainnet. By remapping existing transaction data from real-world blockchains, we are able to observe how Ethereum's PoA protocol behaves under various conditions. Our experiment results show we can simulate Ethereum's PoA consensus protocol with a high degree of scalability.", "Published in": [{"name": "2024 10th International Conference on Applied System Innovation (ICASI)", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/10547719/proceeding"}], "Authors": [{"name": "Jui-Che Wang", "from": "Institute of Information Systems and Applications, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu City, Taiwan"}, {"name": "Ren-Song Tsay", "from": "Department of Computer Science, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu City, Taiwan"}], "IEEE keywords": ["Technological innovation", "Scalability", "Bitcoin", "Consensus protocol", "Servers", "Testing"], "Author Keywords": ["blockchain", "simulation", "consensus protocol", "ethereum", "scalability"]}
