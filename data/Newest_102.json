Issues with traditional land registration processes include slowness, fraud, and a lack of openness. The conventional land registration system, which is still in use in many nations, has several problems, including corruption, integrity issues, and inaccurate data. Document discrepancies resulting from data errors discovered during the land registration procedure give rise to ownership rights disputes. One use case involves several middleman and central institutions is land registration, which boosts trust and confidence in the system. By eliminating intermediaries and centralized organizations, land registration will be quicker. It is challenging to keep track of who owns what land when hundreds or even thousands of land records need to be kept up to date. A straightforward decentralized land registration application was created using the Ethereum Blockchain. This technology allows the transaction process to have just two clients (buyer, seller) and to be visible at all times. This paper presents a novel approach to digital land registration using blockchain technology and smart contracts. The research looks at these technologies\u2019 intricacies and speculates on how they might totally change the process of registering land. This paper offers a thorough examination of existing state of affairs and potential obstacles with regard to the integration of blockchain technology and smart contracts into land registration increases efficiency and computational costs thus by enhancing digitizing land records by improving trust and transparency.", "Published in": [{"name": "2024 2nd International Conference on Advancement in Computation & Computer Technologies (InCACCT)", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/10550186/proceeding"}], "Authors": [{"name": "A.
