Aiming at the problems of data authenticity and integrity in the traditional storage methods of electronic evidence, and the existing blockchain storage schemes fail to give good consideration to the storage cost and efficiency. This paper proposes a model for electronic evidence storage, which uses directed acyclic graph to optimize the efficiency of on-chain storage of electronic evidence. Experimental results show that the proposed model is effective and practical.", "Published in": [{"name": "2021 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain Technology (AIBT)", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/9693894/proceeding"}], "Authors": [{"name": "Zhikun Miao", "from": "School of Computing, Qinghai Normal University, Xining, China"}, {"name": "Chengxu Ye", "from": "School of Computing, Qinghai Normal University, Xining, China"}, {"name": "Ping Yang", "from": "School of Geographical Sciences, Qinghai Normal University, Xining, China"}, {"name": "Ying Chen", "from": "School of Computing, Qinghai Normal University, Xining, China"}, {"name": "Yutao Chen", "from": "School of Computing, Qinghai Normal University, Xining, China"}], "IEEE keywords": ["Directed acyclic graph", "Costs", "Blockchains", "Artificial intelligence", "Optimization"], "Author Keywords": ["blockchain", "electronic evidence storage", "IPFS", "DAG"]}
