However, the operation efficiency (about 10min/per block) has limited its practical application except of Bitcoin. In this paper, we conduct further research based on the existing hybrid blockchain architectures, say N + X Hybrid Blockchain, which may significantly improve blockchain efficiency with the negligible cost of security. Moreover, we gave an evaluation model for the feedback process of nodes in the N+X Hybrid Blockchain and obtained optimal strategies. For the application of Energy Internet (EI), we proposed a scheduling mechanism based on the above evaluation model, and given an algorithm to implement it.", "Published in": [{"name": "2019 21st International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology (ICACT)", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/8694794/proceeding"}], "Authors": [{"name": "Peipei Wang", "from": "School of Computer, Beijing Information Science and Technology University, China"}, {"name": "Kun Meng", "from": "Joint Lab of Sensing and Computational Intelligence, Beijing Information Science and Technology University, China"}, {"name": "Shuqin Li", "from": "Joint Lab of Sensing and Computational Intelligence, Beijing Information Science and Technology University, China"}], "IEEE keywords": ["Blockchain", "Bitcoin", "Delays", "Peer-to-peer computing", "Economics", "Optimal scheduling"], "Author Keywords": ["Blockchain", "Efficiency Optimization", "Energy Internet", "N+X Hybrid Blockchain"]}
