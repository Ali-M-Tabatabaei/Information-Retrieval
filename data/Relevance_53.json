Networks based on Proof-of-Authority (PoA) and compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) are particularly advantageous in this scenario, providing both efficiency and straightforward setup. While private blockchains inherently enhance security by their permissioned nature, which restricts node participation to authorised entities only, it\u2019s crucial to recognise the ongoing necessity for additional safeguards. These safeguards are essential to guarantee that only verified and trustworthy smart contracts are deployed. A key concern in this realm is addressing particular attack vectors, such as front-running attacks. This paper presents an innovative proxy-layer solution designed to integrate effortlessly with any EVM-compatible blockchain, thereby strengthening both governance and security aspects.", "Published in": [{"name": "2023 IEEE International Conference on Blockchain (Blockchain)", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/10411431/proceeding"}], "Authors": [{"name": "Yonghao Wang", "from": "College of Computing, Birmingham City University, UK"}, {"name": "Jahid Ali", "from": "MEER Labs Limited, UK"}, {"name": "Junaid Arshad", "from": "College of Computing, Birmingham City University, UK"}, {"name": "Yunxia Liu", "from": "Zhengzhou Normal University, China"}], "IEEE keywords": ["Smart contracts", "Market research", "Virtual machining", "Blockchains", "Security"], "Author Keywords": ["EVM", "Blockchain", "PoA", "Proxy", "Smart Contract"]}
