In particular, the performance of the Hyperledger Fabric platform is evaluated in terms of: (a) throughput, i.e., successful transactions per second; (b) latency, i.e., response time per transaction in seconds; and (c) scalability, i.e., number of participants serviceable by the platform. The results indicate that the instance of Hyperledger Fabric platform being implemented can support up to 100,000 participants on the selected AWS EC2 instance. As long as the transaction rate is maintained within 200 transactions per seconds, the network latency is in the order of fraction of a second.", "Published in": [{"name": "2019 IEEE International Conference on Blockchain (Blockchain)", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/8938397/proceeding"}], "Authors": [{"name": "Murat Kuzlu", "from": "Electrical Engineering Technology, Old Dominion University, Norfolk, VA, USA"}, {"name": "Manisa Pipattanasomporn", "from": "Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Tech \u2013 Advanced Research Institute, Arlington, VA, USA"}, {"name": "Levent Gurses", "from": "Movel, Inc., Sterling, VA"}, {"name": "Saifur Rahman", "from": "Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Tech \u2013 Advanced Research Institute, Arlington, VA, USA"}], "IEEE keywords": ["Blockchain", "Distributed ledger", "Fabrics", "Throughput", "Scalability", "Benchmark testing", "Peer-to-peer computing"], "Author Keywords": ["Blockchain", "Hyperledger fabric", "throughput", "latency"]}
