Bugs in these contracts have led to significant financial loss. Verifying the correctness of smart contracts is, therefore, an important task. This paper presents an automated safety verification tool, DCV, that targets declarative smart contracts written in De-Con, a logic-based domain-specific language for smart contract implementation and specification. DCV proves safety properties by mathematical induction and can automatically infer inductive invariants using heuristic patterns, without annotations from the developer. Our evaluation on 23 benchmark contracts shows that DCV is effective in verifying smart contracts adapted from public repositories, and can verify contracts not supported by other tools. Furthermore, DCV significantly outperforms baseline tools in verification time.", "Published in": [{"name": "2024 IEEE/ACM 46th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE)", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/10548016/proceeding"}], "Authors": [{"name": "Haoxian Chen", "from": "ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"}, {"name": "Lan Lu", "from": "University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA"}, {"name": "Brendan Massey", "from": "University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA"}, {"name": "Yuepeng Wang", "from": "Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada"}, {"name": "Boon Thau Loo", "from": "University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA"}], "IEEE keywords": ["Smart contracts", "Semantics", "Manuals", "Benchmark testing", "Mathematical models", "Safety", "Logic"], "Author Keywords": ["Smart contracts", "declarative programming", "formal verification"]}
