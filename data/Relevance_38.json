Since the Bitcoin protocol is open source. This concept has led to the idea develop of smart contract. Blockchain technology can apply in non-Financial Uses which have application examples in many industries include energy sector. Energy Sector can apply this technology from grid management to retail & customer experience that will transformation to new business model.", "Published in": [{"name": "2018 International Conference and Utility Exhibition on Green Energy for Sustainable Development (ICUE)", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/8631358/proceeding"}], "Authors": [{"name": "Pholapatara Ratanasopitkul", "from": "Strategic Planning Department, The Metropolitan Electricity Authority (MEA), Bangkok, Thailand"}], "IEEE keywords": ["Blockchain", "Smart contracts", "Peer-to-peer computing", "Bitcoin", "Computers"], "Author Keywords": ["Blockchain", "blockchain platforms", "peer-to-peer transactions", "smart contract", "type of blockchains"]}
