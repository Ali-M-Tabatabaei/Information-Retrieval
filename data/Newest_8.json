Developers can implement complex contracts, such as auctions and lending, on Ethereum using the Solidity programming language. As an object-oriented language, Solidity provides libraries within its syntax to facilitate code reusability and reduce development complexity. Library misuse refers to the incorrect writing or usage of libraries, resulting in unexpected results, such as introducing vulnerabilities during library development or incorporating an unsafe library during contract development. Library misuse could lead to contract defects that cause financial losses. Currently, there is a lack of research on library misuse. To fill this gap, we collected more than 500 audit reports from the official websites of five audit companies and 223,336 real-world smart contracts from Etherscan to measure library popularity and library misuse. Then, we defined eight general patterns for library misuse; three of them occurring during library development and five during library utilization, which covers the entire library lifecycle. To validate the practicality of these patterns, we manually analyzed 1,018 realworld smart contracts and publicized our dataset. We identified 905 misuse cases across 456 contracts, indicating that library misuse is a widespread issue. Three patterns of misuse are found in more than 50 contracts, primarily due to developers lacking security awareness or underestimating negative impacts. Additionally, our research revealed that vulnerable libraries on Ethereum continue to be employed even after they have been deprecated or patched. Our findings can assist contract developers in preventing library misuse and ensuring the safe use of libraries.", "Published in": [{"name": "2024 IEEE/ACM 46th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE)", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/10548016/proceeding"}], "Authors": [{"name": "Mingyuan Huang", "from": "Sun Yat-Sen University, China"}, {"name": "Jiachi Chen", "from": "Sun Yat-Sen University, China"}, {"name": "Zigui Jiang", "from": "Sun Yat-Sen University, China"}, {"name": "Zibin Zheng", "from": "Sun Yat-Sen University, China"}], "IEEE keywords": ["Computer languages", "Current measurement", "Smart contracts", "Companies", "Writing", "Syntactics", "Libraries"], "Author Keywords": ["Blockchain", "Ethereum", "Library Misuse", "Empirical Study"]}
