It lies its foundation on that of quantum mechanics to execute computations that are much more efficient than traditional computation. The basic building block of quantum computing is the qubit, which can exist in multiple states at once, allowing for simultaneous calculations to take place. The combination of quantum computing with artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to create powerful new applications in various domains, including the discovery of drugs, financial models, and sophisticated optimization problems. By leveraging the speed and efficiency of quantum computing, AI algorithms can be run faster and more accurately, leading to significant improvements in prediction accuracy and decision\u2010making. Similarly, quantum computing has the potential to enhance the security and efficiency of blockchain technologies. By using the principles of quantum mechanics, it is possible to create more secure and efficient cryptographic algorithms, which can improve the security and privacy of blockchain networks. Additionally, quantum computing can be used to improve the scalability and efficiency of blockchain networks, allowing for faster and more efficient transaction processing. Hence, the combination of quantum computing with AI and blockchain technologies has the potential to create new opportunities for innovation and disruption across a wide range of industries. While the technology is still in its early stages, the potential benefits are significant, and continued research and development are likely to lead to further breakthroughs in the years to come. Hence, this chapter will discuss such topics in detail, which will help researchers find quality information regarding these emerging topics.", "Published in": [], "Authors": [{"name": "Amit Kumar Tyagi", "from": "Department of Fashion Technology, National Institute of Fashion Technology, New Delhi, Delhi, India"}, {"name": "Anand Kumar Mishra", "from": "Computer Science and Engineering, NIIT University, Neemrana, Rajasthan, India"}, {"name": "S.
