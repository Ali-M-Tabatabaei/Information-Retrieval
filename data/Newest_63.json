But PKI is vulnerable to failures of Certificate Authorities (CAs), which could allow illegal certificates to be issued to the end users. The security of the corresponding end users is at danger if a CA is compromised, as seen by numerous recent breaches. Blockchain technology is a new solution that has the ability to address the issues with traditional PKI systems, specifically the removal of single points of failure and the quick response to CA flaws. Blockchain technology facilitates the management and archiving of digital certificates in an unchangeable, publicly accessible ledger, producing a history log that can be completely tracked. In this article, the classical and modern blockchain-based PKI strategies were explained in addition to illustrating the limitations of each strategy. Finally, this article analyzed PKI methods by comparing their features according to a number of parameters.", "Published in": [{"name": "2024 21st International Multi-Conference on Systems, Signals & Devices (SSD)", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/10548020/proceeding"}], "Authors": [{"name": "Dena S.
