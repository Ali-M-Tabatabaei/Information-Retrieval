Rule-based detection approaches rely on predefined rules with limited capabilities and domain knowledge dependency. Additionally, using static information like opcodes and transactions for machine learning models fails to effectively characterize the Ponzi contracts, resulting in poor reliability and interpretability. In this paper, we propose PonziGuard, an efficient Ponzi scheme detection approach based on contract runtime behavior. Inspired by the observation that a contract's runtime behavior is more effective in disguising Ponzi contracts from the innocent contracts, Ponzi-Guard establishes a comprehensive graph representation called contract runtime behavior graph (CRBG), to accurately depict the behavior of Ponzi contracts. Furthermore, it formulates the detection process as a graph classification task, enhancing its overall effectiveness. We conducted comparative experiments on a ground-truth dataset and applied PonziGuard to Ethereum Mainnet. The results show that PonziGuard outperforms the current state-of-the-art approaches and is also effective in open environments. Using PonziGuard, we have identified 805 Ponzi contracts on Ethereum Mainnet, which have resulted in an estimated economic loss of 281,700 Ether or approximately $500 million USD.", "Published in": [{"name": "2024 IEEE/ACM 46th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE)", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/10548016/proceeding"}], "Authors": [{"name": "Ruichao Liang", "from": "Wuhan University, China"}, {"name": "Jing Chen", "from": "Wuhan University, China"}, {"name": "Kun He", "from": "Wuhan University, China"}, {"name": "Yueming Wu", "from": "Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"}, {"name": "Gelei Deng", "from": "Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"}, {"name": "Ruiying Du", "from": "Wuhan University, China"}, {"name": "Cong Wu", "from": "Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"}], "IEEE keywords": ["Economics", "Runtime", "Biological system modeling", "Smart contracts", "Pressing", "Machine learning", "Reliability"], "Author Keywords": ["Smart Contract", "Ponzi Scheme", "Flow Analysis", "Graph Neural Net-works"]}
